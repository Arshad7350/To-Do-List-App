2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter a task in the input field and click **Add**.
4. Click on a task to mark it as **completed**.
5. Click the **×** icon to **delete** a task.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The **input field** collects user tasks.
- The **Add** button creates a new list item (`<li>`).
- Clicking on a task toggles the **checked** class.
- Clicking the ❌ (×) icon removes the task.
- The list is saved in `localStorage` so it stays even after refreshing or reopening the page.
